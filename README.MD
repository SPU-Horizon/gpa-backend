## Build the Application

1. Create a top-level *GPA* directory to store the source code of *gpa-frontend* and *gpa-backend*.
2. Clone the [gpa-backend](https://github.com/SPU-Horizon/gpa-backend) repository inside the *GPA* directory.
3. Clone the [gpa-frontend](https://github.com/SPU-Horizon/gpa-frontend) repository inside the *GPA* directory.
4. In the *gpa-frontend* directory, run the following terminal commands:
   - `npm ci`
   - `npm run build`
5. In the *gpa-backend* directory, run the following terminal commands:
   - `npm ci`
6. Open MySQL WorkBench and connect to the MySQL localhost instance.
