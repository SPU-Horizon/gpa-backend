We have learned a tremendous amount about our planet but the complexity of climate prevents us from making precise predictions. The majority of climate scientists agree that dramatic action may be needed very soon, yet effective responses could radically alter our lifestyles and economic systems. In this course we will engage with the complexity of climate science and energy policy. We will work together to construct strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and we will critically consider the implications of these strategies. This course will be project based with a strong emphasis on specific, tangible actions to address the challenge of climate change in a manner that is sustainable and equitable.","Add to calendar
